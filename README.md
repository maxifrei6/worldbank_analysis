## General Instruction

This is the repository for the World Bank Project. To ensure the performance of our programs, please read this instruction before running the codes.

We use R Version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14). Some of our packages are dependent on the latest version of R. If you are using other versions, you may encounter errors while installing them.

For a detailed list of loaded packages, please refer to "env_setup.R" under the root directory of our project.

## Usage

First of all, please source the "env_setup.R" file. This will install all the necessary packages and load necessary data sets for programs.

Then, for single analysis programs, simply knit the corresponding, topically divided Rmd files under the "Analysis" directory or refer to the first overview of all observed indicators by sourcing the "indicators.R" file in the "Scripts" directory. For single programs regarding general data processing, simply source the corresponding R file under the "Scripts" directory.

For generating the final report, open either the "presentation.qmd" file (for the original version) or the "presentation_updated.qmd" file (for the feedback-adjusted version) under the project's root directory.

### Data

#### Raw

This directory contains the original data sets from the World Bank project.

#### Processed

This directory contains the data sets generated by the data cleansing step.

Mostly used in analysis programs is "data_merged.RDS". It is the processed version of the original data sets.

### Scripts

This directory contains all the programs for data cleansing as well as the first overview over all the indicators provided by the data set. File names reflect their functionality.

The "functions.R" is worth noting. It contains all the self-written functions used in the programs.

### Results

This directory contains the results (figures and tables) of our analysis. They are all saved in png format.
