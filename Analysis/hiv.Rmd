## Introduction
This analysis explores relationships of HIV prevalence in the population aged 15-49 to the total alcohol consumption per capita as well as its coherence to percentage of labor force with basic education. Therefore we have two main parts:

1. How does the HIV prevalence in the population aged 15-49 relate to the total alcohol consumption per capita?
2. Do countries with higher percentage of labor force with basic education have lower HIV prevalence rates in the 15-49 population?
